2014-12-25 version 6.0.0

    * Updated for WoW 6.0.

    * Fixed an error that occurs when Altoholic does not return a
      character's container data.

    * Added Nathanyel's patch for Reagent Bank support with
      Possessions. All credit goes to him for this! See
      http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=23301.

    * Added Nathanyel's patch for RaresTip support. Again, all credit
      for this goes to Nathanyel.

    * Added Reagent Bank support for Armory and Altoholic.

2012-09-23 version 5.2.0
        
    * Completely rewrote the Armory scanner to work with Armory 5.

2012-09-18 version 5.1.2
        
    * Fixed an issue where mails without attachments would cause
      an error when using Altoholic data.

2012-09-17 version 5.1.1
        
    * This version only affects German and French clients. If
      you are running an English client you do not need this update.
        
    * Fixed a stupid error in the localizations for Void Storage.
        
    * German translations are now complete, except for MoP mines.
      Thanks again to TorenAltair!
        
2012-09-16 version 5.1.0
        
    * Added support for Altoholic.
        
    * Added the "all factions" option. This has actually been
      in the code for a long time, but was never exposed in the
      UI. I don't know why.
        
    * Added the "all realms" option. Currently this only work
      with Altoholic.
        
    * Updated German translations. (Still incomplete though.)
      Thanks to TorenAltair!
        
2012-09-13 version 5.0.1
        
    * Note: This version patches one specific error. You do not
      need to install this update unless you are using German or
      French clients, or if you are seeing a 'bad argument #1'
      error on line 641 of WhoHas.lua.
        
    * Added new strings to the German and French localizations.
      These still need to be translated.
        
    * Modified the code so that it will log a message instead of
      causing an error if a tooltip format string cannot be found.

2012-09-09 version 5.0.0
        
    * Updated for WoW 5.0.4.
    
    * Updated Possessions support to include void storage.
        
    * Removed keyring support.
        
    * Updated to include Cataclysm and Pandaria ores and essences.

2010-12-27 version 4.0.1
        
    * Fixed an Armory incompatibility that got missed in the last
      update.

2010-11-11 version 4.0.0b3
        
    * Patched an incompatibility with recent Armory data changes.

2010-11-09 version 4.0.0b2
        
    * The inventory addon selection can now be explicitly selected
      in the options.
        
    * I am not able to reproduce the errors some users are seeing,
      but I made some adjustments that will hopefully resolve the
      issues for those users.
        
    * Preparing to revise the Armory integration to retrieve data
      through its API, rather than its variables.

2010-10-18 version 4.0.0a1
        
    * Alpha version - includes basic fixes for 4.0. Work in progress.

2009-12-27 version 3.3.1
        
    * Fixed a problem with ArmoryGuildBank data. AGB data has a
      different in-memory format at login than it does after visiting
      the Guild Bank, and WhoHas was only handling the latter format
      correctly. Now WhoHas understands both formats.
        
2009-12-26 version 3.3.0

    * Updated TOC for client 3.3.

    * Fixed the names of Northrend mines (thanks to Pelion).
	
    * Added translations for Northrend additions (courtesy of Pelion
      from ri.gametraveler.ch)

2009-11-29 version 3.2.0

    * Updated TOC for client 3.2.
	
    * Added support for Armory version 7.
	
    * Added some new conversions for WoTLK ores.

2008-11-18 version 3.0.2
        
    * Added support for Armory (finally!).  This is now the preferred backend.
	
    * Added support for the new interface options panel.

2008-11-15 version 3.0.1
     
    * Fixed minor issues with unrecognized tooltips.
	
    * Fixed the placement of info in recipe tooltips.

2008-11-14 version 3.0.0
        
    * Updated TOC for client 3.0.0.

2008-05-18 version 2.4.1
        
    * Added support for LinkWrangler.

2008-04-07 version 2.4.0
    
    * Updated TOC for client 2.4.0.
    
    * Patched a minor issue with Guild Bank items causing Lua errors
      after upgrades.  As of WoW 2.4.0, Guild Bank items may not be
      cached immediately after a client update, and so WhoHas cannot
      immediately get the item info.  The only solution is to revisit
      your Guild Bank after the client has had a chance to update your
      item cache.

2007-12-28 version 2.3.8
        
    * Added the ability to ignore specific items.  Type "/whohas
      ignore ITEM NAME" in chat to prevent WhoHas from showing tooltips
      for an item.
        
    * Added the ability to display guild bank contents for alts.  Note
      that Possessions doesn't yet record the faction a guild belongs
      to, so WhoHas may show guild banks for both factions if you're
      using Possessions.
        
    * Added the ability to track and display guild bank contents by
      tab.  Note that Possessions doesn't break guild bank contents out
      by tab, so WhoHas will use its built-in guild bank tracking if you
      enable counts by tab.
        
    * Added display of lesser/greater enchanting essences when
      hovering over greater/lesser essences.

2007-12-22 version 2.3.7
        
    * Added display of primal counts for mote tooltips.
        
    * Added display of metal bar counts for ore tooltips.
        
    * Added display of ore counts for mine tooltips.
        
    * Added German and French translations, courtesy of Pelion of Curse.com.
        
    * Fixed enchanting recipes to display properly.

2007-12-09 version 2.3.6

    * Added support for guild bank data from Siz's Possessions.  
      If WhoHas detect's Siz's Possessions, it will use that data and will
      not scan the guild bank itself.

    * Fixed a guild bank conflict with Siz's Possessions.

    * Added support for Inventory and Bank Bag data from Siz's Possessions.

2007-12-08 version 2.3.5

    * Fixed a problem with tooltip info showing up twice in some cases.

    * Added a setting to disable world tooltip info.

    * Added support for CharacterProfiler inbox handling of multiple-item 
      mails. 

2007-12-01 version 2.3.4

    * Fixed the mail support I broke in 2.3.3.

2007-11-30 version 2.3.3

    * Added Guild Bank support. WhoHas will now scan and summarize your 
      guild bank contents by itself - no other addons needed. Guild
      bank contents are only guaranteed correct while you have the
      guild bank window open. If other guild members change the guild bank
      at other times, WhoHas will not see the change until you visit
      the guild bank again.

    * Changed the way tooltips are detected. This makes WhoHas play 
      better with Baggins and other addons that implement
      UpdateTooltip. World, minimap, and buff/debuff tooltips are
      still handled the old way and may flicker, but item and action
      tooltips should now be stable.

    * Other minor fixes to display options and updating behavior. 

2007-11-23 version 2.3.2

    * Changed the version numbering scheme to reflect the client
      version. The prefix (2.3) now reflects the WoW version, and the
      last number (.2) reflects my revision level in the current
      version.

    * Fixed a minor potential bug when sending mail that could cause
      WhoHas to ignore what you just sent.

    * Added an experimental hack for Baggins. This slightly modifies
      the way Baggins works, so please let me know if it causes any
      conflicts.

2007-11-21 version 2.1.1
    
    * Replacement for the short-lived and buggy 2.1.0 version.
    
    * Fixes a problem where inbox items wouldn't show up when using
      the CharacterProfiler backend.
    
    * Improves the handling of email items. 2.0 would not reflect any
      items mailed to alts until you logged out and in. This version
      updates alt inboxes immediately, and correctly handles
      multi-item mails.

    * This version does NOT correct the Baggins problem.

    * This version does NOT use the most recent Possessions email
      fixes for 2.3.

2007-11-20 version 2.1.0 (removed)

2007-11-04 version 2.0.3

    * Fixed to correctly exclude other-faction alts.

2007-10-04 version 2.0.2

    * Modified WhoHas so that it doesn't cause errors when inventory
      data is missing.

2007-10-02 version 2.0.1

    * Fixed a bug that blocked control-clicks on chat links.

2007-09-29 version 2.0

    * Rewrote for better CPU performance. CPU usage is now minimal in
      most cases.

    * Pulled out a few embedded strings so that it is now fully
      localizable.

2007-08-30 version 1.1

    * Added support for Siz's Possessions.

2007-08-19 version 1.0

    * First release of WhoHas.
